# TOS Tracker

A lightweight tracker that helps you organize and manage role claims in a structured way.

This tracker allows you to quickly fill in claims, track confirmations, and manage Random Town roles more efficiently.

It is currently designed for Ranked Practice mode in Town of Salem 1. I'm planning to support other game modes and add more features.

You can try the tracker [here]().

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.
