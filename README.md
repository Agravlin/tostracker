# ToS Tracker

A lightweight tracker for Town of Salem that helps you organize and manage role claims in a structured way.

The tracker allows you to quickly fill in claims, keep track of confirmed roles, and manage Random Town role assignments more efficiently.

It is currently designed for Ranked Practice mode in Town of Salem 1. I'm planning to support other game modes and add more features.

You can try the tracker [here](https://agravlin.github.io/tostracker/).

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
